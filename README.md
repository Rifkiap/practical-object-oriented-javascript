========================================================

... or getting closure on thissuesâ„¢.



What We Will Cover
------------------
 * JavaScript primer, is it functional? is it object oriented? is it funcject orientional?

 * First class functions

 * Closures

 * WTF is this?

 * Why is this that?

 * Seriously WTF is this and how do I force it to make sense

 * Managing scope

 * Building an autocomplete widget with the JS OO building blocks


First Class Functions
_____________________
 * Functions are values just like strings, numbers, arrays, and objects

 * Functions can be assigned to variables and passed as arguments

 * Functions can be manipulated as values

 * Functions can be dynamically created by other functions
